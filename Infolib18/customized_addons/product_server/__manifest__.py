====================
This Odoo module implements a REST API to manage product and warehouse data. It provides endpoints to:
1. List all stockable products in the database.
2. Retrieve specific properties of a product by its ID.
3. Calculate and display the total cost of products by location within a specified warehouse, giving a detailed breakdown per location.

Ideal for seamless integration with external systems, this module enables real-time access to essential product and inventory valuation data.
